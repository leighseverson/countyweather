\title{Return average hourly weather data and a plot showing the location of weather
stations for a particular county.}
\usage{
hourly_fips(
  fips,
  year,
  var = "all",
  coverage = NULL,
  average_data = TRUE,
  station_label = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fips}{A character string of the five-digit U.S. FIPS code of a U.S.
county.}

\item{year}{A four-digit number or vector of numbers indicating the year or
years for which you want to pull hourly data. Values for \code{year} can
be in the range from 1901 to the current year.}

\item{var}{A character vector specifying desired weather variables. For
example, \code{var = c("wind_speed", "temperature")} pulls data on hourly
wind speed and temperature. The core weather variables
available include \code{"wind_direction"}, \code{"wind_speed"},
\code{"ceiling_height"}, \code{"visibility_distance"}, \code{"temperature"},
\code{"temperature_dewpoint"}, \code{"air_pressure"}. Alternatively, you
can specify var = "all" to include additional flag and quality codes.}

\item{coverage}{A numeric value in the range of 0 to 1 that specifies
the desired percentage coverage for the weather variable (i.e., what
percent of each weather variable must be non-missing to include data from
a monitor when calculating daily values averaged across monitors).}

\item{average_data}{TRUE / FALSE to indicate if you want the function to
average daily weather data across multiple monitors.}

\item{station_label}{TRUE / FALSE to indicate if you want your plot of
weather station locations to include labels indicating station usaf id
numbers.}

\item{verbose}{TRUE / FALSE to indicate if you want the function to print
out the name of the county it's processing.}
}
\value{
A list with six elements. The first element (\code{hourly_data}) is a
   dataframe of daily weather data averaged across multiple stations, as well
   as columns (\code{"var"_reporting}) for each weather variable showing the
   number of stations contributing to the average for that variable for that
   hour. The second element (\code{station_metadata}) is a dataframe of station
   metadata for stations included in the \code{daily_data} dataframe, as
   well as statistical information about the values contriuted to each
   weather variable by each station. The third element (\code{station_map})
   is a plot showing points for all weather stations for a particular county
   satisfying the conditions present in \code{hourly_fips}'s arguments
   (year, coverage, and/or weather variables). \code{radius} is the
   calculated radius within which stations were pulled from the county's
   center. Elements \code{lat_center} and \code{lon_center} are the latitude
   and longitude of the county's center.
}
\description{
Given a particular county FIPS code, this function returns a list with two
elements: \code{data}, a dataframe of hourly average weather values, and
\code{plot}, a plot showing the location of weather stations contributing to
the average weather in \code{data}.
